# K-Means Clustering

This section of the repository covers the implementation and explanation of K-Means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data.

## Overview

K-Means clustering is a simple and efficient algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into a predetermined number of clusters. It works by iteratively assigning each data point to the nearest centroid and then recalculating the centroids based on the mean of the data points assigned to each cluster. This process continues until convergence, resulting in clusters with centroids that minimize the within-cluster variance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for demonstrating K-Means clustering implementations and examples has been obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset, titled "Facebook Live Sellers in Thailand," contains information about Facebook Live sellers in Thailand. Live selling is becoming increasingly popular in Asian countries, where small vendors can now reach a wider audience and connect with many customers. The dataset includes features such as the number of views, number of shares, number of reactions, and number of comments. The goal of K-Means clustering on this dataset could be to identify distinct groups of Facebook Live sellers based on their engagement metrics.
