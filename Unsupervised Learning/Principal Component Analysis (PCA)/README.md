# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This section of the repository covers the implementation and explanation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in machine learning and data analysis.

## Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method used to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets while preserving most of the information. It achieves this by transforming the original variables into a new set of orthogonal variables called principal components. These principal components are linear combinations of the original variables and are ordered in such a way that the first principal component captures the maximum variance in the data, the second component captures the maximum remaining variance orthogonal to the first, and so on. By retaining only the first few principal components that capture the most variance, PCA helps in simplifying the dataset and making it more manageable for analysis and modeling.

## Dataset

The dataset used for demonstrating PCA implementations and examples is "Crowdedness at the Campus Gym.csv". This dataset consists of 26,000 people counts (about every 10 minutes) over the last year. In addition, extra information including weather and semester-specific information that might affect how crowded it is has been gathered. The label is the number of people, which we'd like to predict given some subset of the features.
