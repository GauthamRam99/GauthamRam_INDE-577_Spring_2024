# DBSCAN Clustering

This section of the repository covers the implementation and explanation of DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data.

## Overview

DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that is particularly effective at identifying clusters of arbitrary shape in spatial datasets. It works by grouping together points that are closely packed together, defining clusters as regions of high density separated by regions of low density.

## Dataset

The dataset used for demonstrating DBSCAN clustering implementations and examples is "Mall_Customers.csv.xls". This dataset is created for the learning purpose of customer segmentation concepts, also known as market basket analysis. It contains basic data about customers of a supermarket mall, including Customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The spending score is assigned to customers based on defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

### About the Dataset

Context: This dataset is created for the learning purpose of customer segmentation concepts, also known as market basket analysis. It will be used to demonstrate unsupervised ML techniques, particularly the KMeans Clustering Algorithm.

Content: The dataset includes basic data about customers of a supermarket mall, including Customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

Problem Statement: The owner of the mall wants to understand the customers, particularly who can be easily converged (target customers), so that marketing strategies can be planned accordingly.
