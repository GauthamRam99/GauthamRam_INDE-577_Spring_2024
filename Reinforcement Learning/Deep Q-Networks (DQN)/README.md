# Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

This section of the repository covers the implementation and explanation of Deep Q-Networks (DQN), a powerful reinforcement learning algorithm used for solving decision-making tasks in environments with discrete action spaces.

## Overview

Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to approximate the optimal action-value function. It has been successfully applied to a wide range of tasks, including playing Atari games, robotic control, and autonomous driving. DQN learns to make decisions by interacting with the environment, observing states, taking actions, and receiving rewards, aiming to maximize the cumulative reward over time.

## Dataset

Deep Q-Networks (DQN) does not require a pre-defined dataset like supervised learning algorithms. Instead, it learns directly from interaction with the environment. The environment provides observations (states) to the agent, and the agent selects actions based on these observations. After taking actions, the environment provides rewards and new observations, and the agent learns from this experience to improve its policy.
