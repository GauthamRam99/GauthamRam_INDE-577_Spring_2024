# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Model in Reinforcement Learning

This notebook demonstrates the implementation and explanation of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm used for training policies in environments with continuous action spaces.

## Overview

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a policy gradient method that aims to improve stability and sample efficiency in reinforcement learning. It addresses some of the limitations of traditional policy gradient methods, such as high variance and poor sample efficiency, by introducing a clipped objective function and a surrogate objective that constrains the policy update. PPO has been shown to achieve impressive results in various tasks, including robotic control, game playing, and simulated environments.

## Notebook Contents

The notebook includes:

- Introduction to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Implementation of the PPO algorithm
- Training a policy in a simulated environment
- Evaluation of the trained policy's performance
- Visualization of training progress and policy behavior

## Dataset

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) does not require a pre-defined dataset like supervised learning algorithms. Instead, it learns directly from interaction with the environment. The environment provides observations (states) to the agent, and the agent selects actions based on these observations. After taking actions, the environment provides rewards and new observations, and the agent learns from this experience to improve its policy.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Reinforcement learning libraries (e.g., OpenAI Gym, Stable Baselines)
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
