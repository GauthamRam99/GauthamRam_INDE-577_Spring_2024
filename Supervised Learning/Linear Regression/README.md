# Linear Regression

This section of the repository covers the implementation and explanation of Linear Regression, a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous outcomes.

## Overview

Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It works by fitting a straight line to the data points that best represents the linear relationship between the variables. Linear Regression is widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, and healthcare, for making predictions and understanding the relationship between variables.

## Dataset

The dataset used for demonstrating Linear Regression implementations and examples is "medical_insurance.csv". This dataset contains 1338 observations on 7 variables related to medical insurance premiums:

- Age: the age of the insured recipients.
- Sex: sex of insured persons; "male" or "female".
- BMI: body mass index, providing an understanding of the body's weight relative to height.
- Children: number of children covered by health insurance or number of dependents.
- Smoker: indicates whether the insured smokes or not.
- Region: the recipientâ€™s residential area in the United States (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
- Charges: individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

### About the Dataset

Many factors influence the amount an insured pays for medical insurance, some of which are beyond their control. This dataset provides insights into the factors influencing the cost of medical insurance premiums. It includes information such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and medical costs.
