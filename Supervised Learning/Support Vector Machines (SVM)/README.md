# Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This section of the repository covers the implementation and explanation of Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

## Overview

Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a versatile machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the data into different classes while maximizing the margin between classes. SVM is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and is capable of capturing complex relationships in the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for demonstrating Support Vector Machines implementations and examples is "creditcard.csv". This dataset is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing both legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 to 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers conducting transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

### About the Dataset
