# k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Algorithm with Diabetes Dataset

This repository contains an implementation and explanation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm applied to the "diabetes.csv" dataset.

## Overview

The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a simple and versatile machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the k nearest data points in the training set to a given input data point and then making predictions based on the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of these nearest neighbors.

## Dataset

The "diabetes.csv" dataset consists of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on. The goal is to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on these medical predictors.

### About this File

The "diabetes.csv" file contains the following columns:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the patient has diabetes or not

## Implementation

The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm implementation in this repository includes:

- Loading the "diabetes.csv" dataset
- Preprocessing the data (e.g., handling missing values, scaling features)
- Implementing the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm
- Training the model and making predictions
- Evaluating the model's performance

## Dependencies

To run the implementation, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
