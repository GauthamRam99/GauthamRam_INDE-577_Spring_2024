# Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning

This section of the repository covers the implementation and explanation of Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning, a powerful set of supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks.

## Overview

Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning techniques, such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost, are widely used in machine learning for making predictions and understanding complex relationships in data. Decision Trees are intuitive models that partition the feature space into regions and make predictions based on simple rules. Ensemble Learning methods combine multiple individual models to improve predictive performance and robustness.

## Dataset

The dataset used for demonstrating Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning implementations and examples is "UCI_Credit_Card.csv". This dataset is aimed at the case of customer default payments in Taiwan and contains information about credit card customers. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. Because the real probability of default is unknown, this study presented the novel Sorting Smoothing Method to estimate the real probability of default.

### About the Dataset

This dataset provides insights into customer default payments in Taiwan and is valuable for risk management purposes. It includes features such as customer demographics, credit card usage, and payment history. The goal is to predict the probability of default accurately, which is essential for effective risk assessment.
