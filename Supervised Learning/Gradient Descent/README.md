# Gradient Descent with Housing Dataset

This repository contains an implementation and explanation of Gradient Descent, a fundamental optimization algorithm used in machine learning, applied to the "Housing.csv" dataset from Kaggle.

## Overview

Gradient Descent is a first-order optimization algorithm used for minimizing the loss function during model training. It iteratively updates the parameters of the model in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss function. Gradient Descent is widely used in various machine learning models, including linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks, for finding the optimal parameters that minimize the prediction error.

## Dataset

The "Housing.csv" dataset is used for demonstrating Gradient Descent implementation. This dataset contains information about housing prices, along with various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location. Here are some of the columns included in the dataset:

- **price**: The price of the house.
- **area**: The area of the house in square feet.
- **bedrooms**: The number of bedrooms in the house.
- **bathrooms**: The number of bathrooms in the house.
- **stories**: The number of stories in the house.
- **mainroad**: Whether the house is located on the main road (binary: 1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **guestroom**: Whether the house has a guest room (binary: 1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **basement**: Whether the house has a basement (binary: 1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **hotwaterheating**: Whether the house has hot water heating (binary: 1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **airconditioning**: Whether the house has air conditioning (binary: 1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **parking**: The number of parking spaces available with the house.
- **prefarea**: Whether the house is located in a preferred area (binary: 1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **furnishingstatus**: The furnishing status of the house.

## Implementation

The Gradient Descent implementation in this repository includes:

- Loading the "Housing.csv" dataset
- Preprocessing the data (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Implementing Gradient Descent algorithm
- Training a linear regression model using Gradient Descent
- Evaluating the trained model's performance

## Dependencies

To run the implementation, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
